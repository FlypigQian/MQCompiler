The purpose of constructing an AST is that:
    1. the parse tree genereated by antlr has only limited ability.
        Its nodes are plain and simple, with few methods or fields,
        which means their polymorphism ability is low (can't do what
        you wanna them to do), and they cannot hold as much synthesized
        attribute as you want.

    2. build ast frame out of parse tree is only the first small step of
        ast IR building, which followed by several passes of semantic
        analysis: variable resolution, type checking, quads building, etc.
        They require polymorphism to accomplish such a complicated job.



Hence, I need to reconstruct parse tree in the form of ast, honestly.
