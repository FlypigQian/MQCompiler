Language antlr_tools.grammar consists of three parts: declaration, statement, expression.

Statement: control jump, etc...

Expression is characterized by its value, each of which is associated with suitable data type.
Expression is a recursively constructed antlr_tools.grammar rule.

The basic expression is building block data type parsed from the bottom of source code.
The inductive step is done by exerting operations upon them, where the operation priority hierarchy matters.

The basic expression is also constructed recursively with respect to arrayAccess and classMember access.

Basic PrimaryExp and Exp can be communicated bi-directly.
The reason for us to introduce PrimaryExp is mainly because of the operation priority.
